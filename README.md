# Oh.Studio - Redesigned

This is a fully redesigned version of the [Oh.Studio](https://oh.studio/) website, focusing on modern animations, advanced UI elements. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with GSAP for animations. The goal of this redesign is to create a visually appealing and highly interactive user experience that enhances the original design while optimizing performance.

## Features

- Currently designed for desktop screens, with future plans for responsiveness on smaller devices
- Smooth animations implemented using GSAP for a modern and seamless browsing experience
- Custom project showcase layout designed to highlight the work effectively
- Dynamic footer with interactive elements that enhance user engagement
- Optimized for performance with clean and efficient code
- Modular and well-structured codebase for easy customization and further development

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the Repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/akshprooo/oh.studio
   cd oh.studio
   ```

2. open command prompt in the cloned repo's directory and run the command:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

   Ensure you have \`node.js\` installed. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you edit the code.

Another Method is to run the following command in the same directory:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command creates a new folder `dist` in the directory.. this `dist` folder has the source files built so you can just open up the html file in any browser of your choice.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages several modern web technologies to achieve a high-quality user experience. Below are the primary technologies used in this redesign:

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure of the webpage with semantic elements.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling, including flexbox and grid for layout, as well as animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Adds interactivity and dynamic elements to the page.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: Enables smooth animations for a visually engaging experience.
- **Lenis :** Used To Enhance the Scrolling Experience Of the Viewer
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control system to track changes and collaborate effectively.

## Why This Redesign?

The original Oh.Studio website features a clean and minimal design, but this redesign aims to push the boundaries of interactivity while maintaining simplicity. The focus is on creating an engaging user experience that stands out. By incorporating animations, interactive elements, and an optimized structure, this version enhances the overall feel of the website.

## Future Improvements

There are several potential improvements and additional features that can be integrated into this project:

- Adding more advanced scroll-based animations for a dynamic experience
- Implementing lazy loading for images and assets to improve performance
- Enhancing accessibility features to ensure a broader audience can use the website
- Introducing a dark mode toggle for better usability in different lighting conditions
- Further optimizing code structure for maintainability and scalability
